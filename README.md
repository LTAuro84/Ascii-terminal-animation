# Ascii terminal animation

## Description
It takes any video in .mp4 format, converts it to ASCII, and plays it in the terminal. I included one little video that I tested out and it works nicely. However, I haven't tried with any other videos, so results might be different. I did this all on windows, but im sure it will work on macOS and Linux too. 

## Installation
I used OpenCV. Just run this command:

```bash
    pip install opencv-python
```
## Usage
Make sure you're inside the folder, open up your terminal and just type:

```bash
    python main.py
```
## Technologies
This was coded in Python using OpenCV
